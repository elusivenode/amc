    <h2>Why Mathematics Matters</h2>
    <p>Mathematics is more than just numbers and formulas—it's a way of thinking that develops critical reasoning, logical analysis, and problem-solving skills that are valuable throughout life. Our goal is to help students not only improve their math grades but also develop these essential life skills.</p>
